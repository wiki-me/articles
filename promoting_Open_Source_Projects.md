A few suggestions:

Add it to alternativeto.net , [reportedly](https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.com/issues/269#issue-148864159) it is one of liberapay top referrers.

Ask a community member to add it to [slant.co](https://www.slant.co/) (you can't add it yourself because there is a rule against self promotion).

add topics to the github or codeberg or whatever repository .

Link to the those pages from your website and ask for good reviews and likes.

Post to reddit or hacker news or lemmy, don't do it too frequently and the posts should have significant value, once a year seems like a pretty safe bet. saying you are the author and answering questions is also good.

Use [star track](https://seladb.github.io/StarTrack-js/) to measure the success of your promotion efforts and see what works in practice.
